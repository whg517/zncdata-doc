# Introduction

Kubedoop is a big data platform developed based on Kubernetes Operator technology. Through the Kubedoop platform,
users can quickly deploy and manage data processing tasks in Kubernetes clusters. This includes but is not limited to data collection, data storage,
data processing, and data analysis functionalities.

By leveraging the management capabilities of Kubernetes Operator, Kubedoop can automatically manage the lifecycle of data processing tasks,
including task creation, startup, monitoring, scheduling, restart, and scaling. Users only need to define data processing tasks through simple configuration files,
and Kubedoop can automatically deploy the tasks to the Kubernetes cluster and manage their lifecycle automatically.
